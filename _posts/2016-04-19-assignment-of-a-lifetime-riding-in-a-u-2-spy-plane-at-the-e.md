  Back in 2010, San Francisco-based photographer Christopher Michel received a
  once-in-a-lifetime photo assignment from the US Navel Institute: to ride in
  the back seat of a U-2 spy plane at the "edge of space." At the plane's
  cruising and intelligence-gathering altitude of 70,000 feet above the ground,
  temperatures outside the plane fall to 70 degrees below zero.
